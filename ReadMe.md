# Bouncing Ball Mini-Game

### This Project is Depreciated 
This project served as a way to become familiar and poke around the Ruby language. That's now been fulfilled, but will most likely be returned to to brush up on Ruby in the future. 

### About this Project
Using the GOSU Gem, a minigame was made to control a bouncing ball using pseudo-physics. This project was designed as a 'prompt' for learning and expanding my knowledge on Ruby. After I grew comfortable with simple syntax, I left the project be to focus on other tasks. What was accomplished is as follows:

- Simple Pseudo ball physics, for acceleration and bouncing.
- Ability to give the ball pushes/somewhat directional control.
- The starting of adding platforms to the level, albeit the collision logic is faulty.

Naturally, this project should be considered 'rough' in every sense of the term.

## Notes to Self: Bugs
(I could use issue tracking, but this is of minor tinkering importance)
- After bouncing on bottom boundary of window, ball gains velocity (shouldn't)
- Ball ignores collisions with rectangles sporadically
